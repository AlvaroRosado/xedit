# Templates creation

The biggest feature of Xedit is not only its easy to use what-you-see-is-what-you-get interface, but also the creation of new templates with custom components to speed up the development of new documents.

For this task, we only need to add some new JSON schemas that define our new elements as native templates for the application.
